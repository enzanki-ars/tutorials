## Intro

You probably saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/enzanki_ars/status/713106887537999872)
or [this Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/enzanki.ars/posts/212307295878721)
and wondered what it was all about.  Keybase is a platform where people can
prove their identity across multiple platforms.  In the backend, Keybase uses
the OpenPGP standard in combination with a blockchain.  Today, we will look into
how OpenPGP works.

## How Public Key Cryptography works

Kahn Academy has a very good tutorial on the details and mathematics behind
[cryptography in general](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography)
and [public key cryptography](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography#modern-crypt).
